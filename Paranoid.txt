I dont know if it is just me, but I have been feeling like someone is watching my every move. The other night while I was in my office I heard a sound in the hallway. I thought it was the janitor but could not see anyone. Then when I went to my house I saw a weird van at the end of the street. Maybe I am just paranoid.
